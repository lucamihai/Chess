Or you can download the archive included here.

Instructions for playing in 2 different PCs:
  - establish a connection between the 2 PCs
  - turn on both application (server and client)
  - on the client application, enter the server's IPV4 and then click Connect
    -> you can find out the IPV4 on the PC that has the server app, by opening cmd and finding the ipv4 through the ipconfig command (all you need to do is get the IPV4 address corresponding to the network both PCs are connected through, for example you need to take the Hamachi IPV4 if you're connected through Hamachi, Ethernet IPV4 if you're connected through WI-FI, and so on...)
  - after the connection is established, both players can decide what username they'll have and what's the color of the pieces they will control
    -> this is step is optional, as there are default options for this: the server app user has the username "Server" and controls the white pieces, and the client app user has the username "Client" and controls the black pieces
  - both players click "Start Game"
  - have fun
